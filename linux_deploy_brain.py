linux_deploy_brain.py — The Brain Deploy Orchestrator (native Linux)
===================================================================

The native-Linux sibling of `windows_deploy_brain.py`. Same job — one entry point
that sequences every brain building block into a converging deploy and its inverse —
but for a real Linux host, with **no WSL and no VM**: the brain runs as a native OS
user with rootless Docker in its home, systemd for residency, and a bind mount for
the config seam.

STATUS
    ⚠ NOT YET RUN LIVE. This is the first Linux implementation; it is static-validated
    (`py_compile`) only. It is exercised + hardened by `developer/test_plan_linux_host.md`
    (phases L0–L8). Treat every stage as first-live until that plan goes green. Where a
    portable building block already had a Linux code path (notably `run_as_brain.py`,
    "implemented; NOT exercised"), this driver is its first real caller.

    └─────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
    The portable pieces are SHARED verbatim in spirit: the code package + staging, the
    gateway compose stack (compose.yaml / nginx.conf.template / gen-cert.sh), the
    bootstrap-token mint into brain_etc/gateway/*.map, and the verify curl gates
    (no-token 403 / reader 200 / reset 403). Only the OS-forced pieces above diverge.

WHY LINUX IS SIMPLER
    No idle-VM to hold resident, so residency is "enable linger + a user unit that runs
    `docker compose up -d` at boot" rather than a keepalive holding a WSL utility VM open.
    No drvfs 9p, so the seam is an ordinary read-only bind mount — the v0.8.0 drvfs
    deny-ACE read-wall bug simply does not exist here; read-only is enforced by ownership
    (root-owned tree, brain not in a writing group), not a deny ACE.

FOLLOW-ON (tracked in objectives/008 + 009)
    Two sub-tools are still Windows-shaped and are NOT called here; this driver does their
    Linux-native equivalent inline and flags the port as follow-on:
      - create_brain.py (standalone) → Get-LocalUser/Windows groups; Linux uses useradd here.
      - brain_truths.py               → drvfs + icacls; Linux uses a bind mount + POSIX perms here.
    macOS (Lima/Colima VM, `limactl`) is objective 009, deferred.
