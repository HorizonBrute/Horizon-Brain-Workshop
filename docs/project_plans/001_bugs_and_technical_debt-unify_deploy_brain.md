# Project 001 — Bugs & Technical Debt

Every item must be **FIXED** or **explicitly DEFERRED with rationale and a destination** before the
project closes. Ids are stable: `BUG-001-K` / `DEBT-001-K`.

## BUG-001-1 — Linux gateway TLS cert never generated (false-green)
1. **Observed:** 2026-07-21. Live `dev_brain` gateway nginx crash-loops (`9+` restarts):
   `nginx: [emerg] cannot load certificate "/etc/nginx/certs/cert.pem": No such file or directory`;
   `~dev_brain/gateway/gateway_out/` empty. fail2ban stuck `Created` (shares nginx netns).
2. **Root cause:** `linux_deploy_brain.py:576` calls `gen-cert.sh <posture>` (e.g. `personal`), but
   `gen-cert.sh:26-30` treats positional args as extra SubjectAltName entries → malformed SAN
   (`...,personal`) → openssl exits nonzero → `set -euo pipefail` aborts before writing `cert.pem`.
   `provision_runtime:578` then prints "TLS cert generated" **without checking rc** (false-green).
   Windows calls the same script correctly with no arg (`stage4_brain.sh:99`).
3. **Severity/priority:** HIGH — takes the whole gateway down; must be cleared before close.
4. **Status:** OPEN → to be FIXED by Section 6 (no-arg `gen-cert.sh` + rc check). Deliberately NOT
   patched on the old line per NOTE 001-3 — the fix lands in the unified path / shared cert stage.

## DEBT-001-1 — Linux deploy is missing the ollama_models and neuron_bundles stages
1. **Decision/context:** `linux_deploy_brain.py cmd_deploy` (8 stages) has no `ollama_models` and no
   `neuron_bundles` stage; Windows has both (stages 8–9). A Linux brain never syncs its model roster
   or starts neuron bundles.
2. **Action needed:** the unified `deploy()` (Section 4) must include both stages for both OSes.
3. **Impact:** MEDIUM — a Linux brain's `/ask` 404s until models are pulled; neurons never run.
4. **Status:** OPEN → absorbed by Section 4.

## DEBT-001-2 — Several Windows engine-build steps have no Linux equivalent
1. **Decision/context:** unattended-upgrades policy (`stage5_root.sh`), maintenance tools + timers
   (`stage6_root.sh`/`stage6_brain.sh`), the slir4netns port-driver pin (`stage3_brain.sh`), and the
   full harden posture (`stage7_harden.sh`) are absent from the current Linux path.
2. **Action needed:** the shared build-engine (Section 2) runs these portable stage scripts on both
   OSes, closing the gap for free.
3. **Impact:** MEDIUM — Linux brains lack auto-updates, maintenance timers, and full hardening.
4. **Status:** OPEN → absorbed by Section 2.

## DEBT-001-3 — brain_doctor probes must track the unified deployer's outputs
1. **Decision/context:** `brain_doctor.py` already dispatches per-OS, but its residency/seam/stack
   probes assume the current per-driver artifact names. If unification changes any (unit name, seam
   path, engine layout), the doctor's checks drift.
2. **Action needed:** re-verify `brain_doctor diagnose` against a brain deployed by `deploy_brain.py`
   (Section 8) and adjust probes if needed.
3. **Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM — stale probes mis-report health, not a runtime break.
4. **Status:** OPEN → cleared at Section 8 validation.
