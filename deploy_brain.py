deploy_brain.py — The Brain Deploy Orchestrator (cross-platform: Windows/WSL2 + native Linux)
============================================================================================

One privileged entry point that sequences every brain building block into a single
converging deploy: bare host → account → staged code → engine → residency →
gateway → verified TLS heartbeat. And the inverse: tear it down to rebuild any
time.

PLATFORM
    ONE deployer for both OSes. The Windows path is the trunk; Linux parity is folded
    in and branches only at OS-forced steps (identity switch, engine host+snapshot,
    seam mount, residency, firewall) — everything else is shared (Project 001).
      * Windows/WSL2 — engine = a per-user WSL2 distro (`wsl --import` of a provisioned
        Debian), residency = a Task Scheduler boot task, seam = drvfs (9p) + icacls,
        identity = run_as_brain.py, secrets = Credential Manager.
      * Native Linux — engine = `docker save` images + an ollama-volume tar + baked cert
        under system/linux_engine/ (no VM), residency = a `systemd --user` unit + linger,
        seam = a bind,ro mount unit, identity = `sudo -u <brain> -H`, rootless Docker.
    The runtime OS is detected (`_IS_LINUX`/`_IS_WINDOWS`); an unsupported OS is refused.
    macOS is a later objective. (The former `linux_deploy_brain.py` driver has been
    retired; this file is now the sole Linux deploy path, and brain_doctor imports it.)

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The capability to stand up a brain is real but scattered across lanes:
    account provisioning (create_brain), engine deploy (brain_installer_1/2),
    gateway port/token/firewall (gateway_port / gateway_token), and teardown.
    Nothing *combined* them. This is that layer — the sequencing + preflight +
    verification + teardown driver.

DESIGN
    - **Calls the block CLIs; never imports their internals.** The installers and
      gateway tools keep changing; their stable command-line is the contract. If a
      block changes a flag, adapt the call here — not the block.
    - **Stages are idempotent.** Each checks "already done?" and converges, so a
      re-run after a partial failure is safe and a full re-run is a no-op.
    - **Provider seam for create-brain.** When this deploy runs inside a Horizon.AIOS
      install (detected via $HORIZON_ROOT) it calls the platform's
      $HORIZON_SBIN/horizon_aios_create_brain.py; on any other host it calls the factory's
      standalone create_brain.py. The product must deploy on hosts with no platform at all.
    - **The orchestrator calls the *staged* copies** of the block tools (the ones
      inside brains/<brain>/ after staging), because those resolve their own
      brain-relative paths.

THE ENGINE ARTIFACT
    By default the multi-GB `<brain>_engine.tar` (the provisioned WSL distro image)
    is an INPUT to deploy, not part of the code package: deploy validates it is
    present (or a distro is already imported) and fails loud with the remedy if not;
    supply a prebuilt one with --engine-tar. This keeps infra REUSE the default.

    From-scratch, this orchestrator can ALSO build it. `build-engine` (and
    `deploy --from-scratch`) obtain a base Debian into a throwaway scratch distro,
    run the provision/ recipe (stages 1–9) collapsed into one idempotent flow,
    `wsl --export` the result, and drop the scratch distro. That path REFUSES to
    reuse an existing distro or a stale tar — the point of a cold-start test is a
    freshly built engine.

STAGING — factory/source/ IS the brain root
    `factory/source/` is a one-to-one image of a deployed brain: what you see there
    is what lands in <install-root>/brains/<brain>/. Staging is therefore a single
    `copytree(source, brain_dir)` + a perm pass — no member list, no build step, no
    tarball. The delivered artifact IS this repo. Two rules bound the copy:
      - PROTECTED paths are never overwritten (the brain's own data + live runtime).
      - Everything else is factory-owned and REFRESHED on every deploy, so fixes ship.
    See _STAGE_PROTECT / _STAGE_REFRESH.

INSTALL ROOT
    Explicit or nothing: `--install-root` → `$AIOS_INSTALL_ROOT` → die. This orchestrator
    never guesses where your brains live and never walks up looking for one.

USAGE
    deploy_brain.py deploy   --brain X --posture personal|server
                             [--port N] [--bind personal|server]

                             [--imagefile <path>] [--keep-scratch] [--dry-run]
    deploy_brain.py teardown --brain X [--purge --yes]

    They MUST land on ext4: a nested 9p (drvfs) mount does NOT propagate into rootless docker, so a
    bind-mounted 9p seam shows EMPTY inside the neuron container and the input neuron ingests 0 docs

    The copy SOURCE is a TRANSIENT drvfs mount (deliver_data_seam.sh), not /mnt/c. Server posture
    bakes `[automount] enabled=false` (stage7_harden), so the old /mnt/c read could never work
    there: it failed `cp: cannot stat '/mnt/c/...'`, the input neuron found no provider script and

    A READONLY *directory* cannot be removed, and the failure surfaces as a bare

# Clearing READONLY (above) fixed WinError 5. Underneath it sits a SECOND blocker that
# surfaces as WinError 32 "used by another process", and it has two distinct causes:
#
#   1. The account's registry hives (HKU\<SID> + HKU\<SID>_Classes) stay MOUNTED after the
#      account is deleted. A mounted hive IS an open handle on NTUSER.DAT / UsrClass.dat, so
#      no delete can win until it is unloaded. This is the grain of truth in the old "loaded
#      NTUSER.DAT hive" warning — but its remedy was wrong: a reboot is NOT required, and
#      `reg unload` alone returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED here because (a) an elevated token holds
#      SeRestorePrivilege DISABLED and (b) open keys remain inside the hive. Enabling the
#      privilege and calling NtUnloadKey2(REG_FORCE_UNLOAD) evicts it in place, no reboot.
#
#   2. A live process holds a file INSIDE the profile. Observed: wslsettings.exe pinning
#      %LocalAppData%Low\Intel\ShaderCache\*. `wsl --shutdown` does NOT kill it (it stops
#      distros, not the WSL GUI apps), so it silently leaked the profile on every teardown.
#

# actual holder, which is the difference between a 1-minute fix and another reboot hunt.

#   hns alone ...................... NO NIC
#   WslService + hns ............... NO NIC
#   WslService + vmcompute + hns ... NO NIC  ← shipped as ✅ PROVEN; it is NOT.

#       and the runtime VM STILL came up networkingMode None — that deploy failed at verify.

# This is why "just reboot" looked like the only remedy: a reboot cycles the WHOLE stack. It was
# never evidence that a reboot is required — only that the subset was too small. Do not
# reintroduce a reboot as the recommended fix.
#
