residency.py - shared per-brain BOOT residency task (Task Scheduler).

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE
--------------------------
A freshly-imported WSL2 distro is idle-shutdown by the host when nothing holds it,
so the brain's Chroma TLS gateway is only intermittently reachable between calls.
The fix is a per-brain BootTrigger task that holds the distro resident and brings the
stack up at every boot.

Creating that task is an *admin* concern, NOT a brain-phase one:
  - a BootTrigger "run whether logged on or not" task requires elevation to create; the
    brain account (phase 2) is NOT elevated, so it can never self-register one; and
  - registering it to run as the brain wants a stored credential (Password logon). S4U
    (no password) additionally needs SeTcbPrivilege, which a plain admin does NOT hold
    (`schtasks` returns "Access is denied"), so **Password logon is the default**.

So `brain_installer_1_admin.py` (elevated, and the only place that holds the brain
password) owns registration; this module is the shared implementation it calls. Phase 2
does NOT register residency.

# The boot keepalive, shipped INTO the distro as a FILE (see write_keepalive) and run by the
# task as `bash -l <path>` — deliberately NOT an inline `wsl.exe -- bash -lc "…"` action.
# WHY A FILE: the raw wsl.exe round-trip mangles any quoting the action carries — the
# Task-Scheduler <Arguments> string is re-split by wsl.exe AND again by bash, so a nested
# `bash -lc "…$(seq 1 30)…"` was double-wrapped, its `$( )` spliced newlines, `for` split on
# them, and bash died `syntax error near '2'` (exit 2) BEFORE it ever reached the sleep — the
# distro then idle-shut and the gateway vanished. A script file has no such round-trip.
# WHY NO LOOP: `restart: unless-stopped` on the compose services already auto-starts both
# containers at boot, so the keepalive only has to nudge the stack up once (in case it isn't)
# and then `exec sleep infinity` to hold the WSL VM resident (WSL idle-shuts a distro when
# nothing holds it open). The old `for i in $(seq 1 30)` retry loop was both redundant and the
# exact fragile part; it is gone.
# NOTE: keep this content pure ASCII — it is piped through a Windows->WSL stdin bridge into a
# boot-critical file, so no smart-quotes/em-dashes (encoding surprises have no place here).
