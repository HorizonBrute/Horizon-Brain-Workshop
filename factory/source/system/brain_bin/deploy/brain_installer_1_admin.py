"""
brain_installer_1_admin.py - ADMIN-side deploy of a brain engine (rootless Docker in WSL2).

Run this in an ELEVATED console. It does the host-level "needful", then hands off to
phase 2 (which runs AS the brain user). Presumes:
  - the brain OS user account already exists with correct permissions,
  - the deploy package is unzipped into the brain folder, containing:
      <brain>/system/wsl_engine/<brain>_engine.tar   (the preconfigured WSL distro image)
      <brain>/system/brain_bin/deploy/brain_installer_2_brain.py

What it does:
  1. Resolve brain identity (.brain_provision.json, or --brain NAME).
  2. Read the brain password from the OS keystore (brain:<brain> / account_password, what
     create_brain.py wrote); fall back to $BRAIN_CRED_HELPER, then prompt. Never blocks headless.
  3. Ensure WSL2 is present and updated.
  4. ACL the brain folder so the brain account controls system/wsl_engine/,
     system/deploy_logs/ and knowledge/.
  5. Lock the brain's edit-source (its code + policy) read-only to the brain ACCOUNT
     (Windows-side defense-in-depth for the security model; applied in every posture).
  6. Launch phase 2 AS the brain user (or, with --no-launch, print the runas command).
  7. Register the per-brain BOOT residency (keepalive) task — the only thing that holds
     the WSL distro resident so the stack survives idle-shutdown/reboot (skip: --skip-residency).

Usage:
  python brain_installer_1_admin.py [--brain NAME] [--posture personal|server] [--no-launch]
                                    [--skip-residency]
